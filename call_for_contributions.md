# Call for Contributions

## The Collaborations Workshop motto "Collaborating for the future of Research Software Engineering"

The Collaborations Workshop 2026 is not organized like a traditional scientific conference, that mainly features talks or other forms of one-to-many communication.
Instead, we shift the focus towards interactive, collaborative formats that give the participants room for discussion, action planning and the production of tangible outputs.
In other words, we create a workshop, providing space for those collaborations that are typically contemplated in conference coffee breaks, but then rarely materialize due to a lack of time and collaboration opportunities.

The largest part of the program is organized in sessions of 90-150 minutes, whose methodical format is up to the session organizers to decide. Examples of such formats could e.g. be open discussion rounds, fishbowl sessions, tutorials, hackathons etc. The program will host up to four of these sessions in parallel.
In addition, there will also be contributed lightning talks (1-2 minutes) that allow you to pitch a collaboration idea to the participants.

## Topics

Contributions to the Collaborations Workshop can fall into the following categories, but are not strictly limited to these:

* **Research Software Craftsmanship**: e.g. CI/CD, testing, documentation, software metadata, licensing
* **RSE Education** e.g. curriculum development, teaching best practices, Open educational resources
* **Open Science** e.g. RSE aspects of Open Science like Open methodology, Open source, Open data, Open access, Open peer review
* **Data Science & AI** e.g. best practices for ML/AI, note that there is also the dedicated co-located [Workshop on AI-supported Research Software Engineering](https://events.hifis.net/event/3249/page/968-workshop-on-ai-supported-research-software-engineering)
* **RSE Communities**: e.g. local RSE charters, community management, RSE event planning, deRSE association activities
* **Policy Making**: e.g. institutional research software policies, ethical aspects of RSE, position papers
* **RSE Career Development** e.g. hiring, career pathways
* **RSE Institutions and Initiatives** e.g. establishing local RSE institutions, national and international networks, research software infrastructures
		
## Submission

The submission process is managed via GitHub issues on [this repository](https://github.com/DE-RSE/2026_collaboration_workshop_de). In order to submit a contribution, please open a new issue and provide all information requested by the issue template. As the submission process is managed transparently in the public, feel free to also get in touch with other submitters to combine ideas and prepare sessions together. For this reason, changes to your submission (e.g. adding additional co-organizers) are possible until the **submission deadline on April 15th 2026, [AOE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anywhere_on_Earth)**. However, we highly encourage you to submit early, so that other participants can coordinate their submissions with yours. If your employer requires you to have an accepted conference contribution for authorization of your travel, please consider submitting a lightning talk.
