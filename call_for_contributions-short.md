🚀 **Call for Contributions – Collaborations Workshop 2026 is open!**

The **Collaborations Workshop 2026** is all about *doing*, not just listening. 
Instead of classic conference talks, we focus on **interactive formats** that create space for real collaboration, 
shared problem-solving, and tangible outcomes — the kind of ideas that usually start during coffee breaks and *this time actually happen*. ☕💡

We’re looking for session ideas, collaboration formats, and lightning talks around **Research Software Engineering**: 
from software craftsmanship, education, and Open Science to AI (see also our co-located special
[Workshop on AI-supported Research Software Engineering](https://events.hifis.net/event/3249/page/968-workshop-on-ai-supported-research-software-engineering) , 
policy, RSE community building, and career development. Fishbowl sessions, hackathons, open discussions rounds, tutorials — you name it!

If you have an idea, a challenge, or a collaboration you’d love to kick off with the community: **this is your chance to shape the program** and the conversations. 
Submissions are open until **April 15, 2026 (AOE)** — and early submissions are especially welcome to spark joint ideas.

👉 Details & submission via GitHub:

Let’s collaborate for the future of **#ResearchSoftwareEngineering** — together! 💬🤝
